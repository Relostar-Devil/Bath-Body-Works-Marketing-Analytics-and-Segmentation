## 📌 Objective

This project analyzes the market positioning and customer segmentation of **Bath & Body Works** in the U.S. personal care and home fragrance market. Using perceptual and preference data collected via surveys, we benchmark Bath & Body Works against major competitors and provide strategic recommendations for improved market alignment and growth.

---

## 📊 Methodology Overview

The analysis was conducted using **Enginius**, a marketing analytics platform for perceptual mapping and segmentation. Key steps:

- Collected survey responses from ~70 participants using Google Forms
- Measured perceptions of 4 brands across 5 key attributes
- Captured overall brand preferences, loyalty, and shopping behavior
- Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to derive positioning maps
- Ran **K-means clustering** to segment the market based on customer preferences

---

## 🧠 Key Attributes Analyzed

1. **Fragrance Quality**  
2. **Price Value**  
3. **Packaging Appeal**  
4. **Product Variety**  
5. **Brand Image**

## 🧭 Positioning Analysis

Positioning maps were generated in 2D and 3D to visualize brand positions based on perceptual data.

### 🔹 Dimensions Retained:
- **Dimension I (Product Variety & Brand Image)**
- **Dimension II (Fragrance Quality & Packaging Appeal)**
- **Dimension III (Price Value)**

### 🔹 Findings:
- **Bath & Body Works** ranks high on **Product Variety** and **Packaging**, with a strong brand image.
- **Fragrance Quality**, although critical, is not strongly owned by any brand—offering an opportunity for BBW to differentiate.
- **Victoria’s Secret** scores high on **Packaging Appeal** but suffers on **Value for Money**.
- **Lush** owns the **Sustainability & Quality** space but is niche due to premium pricing.
- **The Body Shop** leads on **Price Value** and **ethical positioning**.

---

## 👥 Segmentation Analysis

Using K-means clustering, three distinct customer segments were identified:

### 🔸 Segment 1: Price-Sensitive Shoppers  
- Focus on value and promotions  
- Lower brand loyalty  
- Threat from Victoria’s Secret’s offers

### 🔹 Segment 2: Balanced Buyers  
- Moderate emphasis on variety and packaging  
- Open to switching if value is aligned  
- Overlaps with The Body Shop’s ethical mid-tier positioning

### 🟢 Segment 3: Premium-Conscious Consumers  
- Strong loyalty to quality and fragrance  
- Preference for premium packaging and exclusivity  
- Competes with Lush’s artisan, sustainable appeal

Bath & Body Works is well-positioned for **Segment 3**, but lacks price-value appeal for Segment 1.

---

## 📈 Market Share Simulation

Simulated using preference data and first-choice decision rules:

- **Bath & Body Works leads** due to strong perception in **variety and brand loyalty**
- However, lacks dominance in **Fragrance Quality**, a key driver across segments

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

1. **Strengthen Differentiation in Fragrance Quality**  
   - Enhance fragrance R&D and exclusive scent collections  
   - Own the "signature scent" space with storytelling  

2. **Introduce Sustainable Premium Lines**  
   - Compete with Lush and The Body Shop on sustainability  
   - Reduce packaging waste; highlight eco-conscious initiatives

3. **Segmented Promotion Strategy**  
   - **BOGO** deals for price-sensitive shoppers  
   - **Loyalty rewards** and **bundled luxury kits** for premium buyers  

4. **Improve Emotional Branding**  
   - Reinforce mood-based marketing (e.g., “Feel Your Best with BBW”)  
   - Collaborate with influencers and wellness communities  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Sample size is limited (~70), mostly students and young adults  
- Geographically skewed toward **Tempe, Arizona**  
- Results are based on stated preferences, not actual purchases
